# MyDiary - Microservices and container based appliation

Sample microservice and container based application, accessed via API Gateway (ocelot). Currently I am planning to use .NET Core 2.2, Docker engine, Azure/AWS/Digital Ocean for hosting micro services, kubernetes. The goal of this project is implement the most common used technologies and share with technical community the best way to develop great application with .NET App

## Architecture overview

The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices which means each owning its own data/db and implementing using simple data driven desing and Domain driven desing using CQRS partten using http as communication protocol and asynchronous communication using event bus (RebbitMQ)
